***Alphonce Training - Batch 2 (Days 15-28)***

This repository contains my training progress for Batch 2 of my Training and Tech Mastery Program. It focuses on intermediate Python concepts, error handling, file handling, and small CLI (command line interface) projects.

**Contents**
-> Day 15 to Day 21: Error handling basics, modules, functions
-> Day 22 to Day 28: Mini-projects (logging, contact CLI, CSV handling, HTTP requests)

**Each day has:
-> Python code file(s) in 02-Python folder locally
-> A corresponding daily log in 99-Logs
-> Notes/documents where applicable

***Lessons learned***
-> Learned how to log errors into files.
-. Practiced handling try/except with real HTTP requests, httpbin.org being my mockup endpoint.
-> Built a simple Contact CLI program using CSV.
-> Strengthened modular programming skills.
