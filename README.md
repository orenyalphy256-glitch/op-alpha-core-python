# Alphonce â€“ Training Journey ðŸš€

This repository documents my **90-day intensive training program** (continuing up to 1 year), where I am building strong foundations in:
- Python programming
- Git & GitHub version control
- Office productivity tools (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
- Troubleshooting & technical projects
- Daily logging and reflections

The repo is organized **batch by batch** (14 days each). This file will be updated progressively as I complete each batch.

## ðŸ“… Progress Overview (Batch 1)

### âœ… Days 1â€“7 (Week 1)
- System setup, Windows maintenance, and folder structure.
- Installed Python + VS Code.
- First Python script (`hello.py`).
- Practiced Word & Excel basics.
- Installed Git, created GitHub account, and pushed first repo.
- Built simple programs:
  - `vars_if_exercises.py`
  - `calculator.py`
- Completed **Week 1 Review** and **Demo Notes**.

### âœ… Days 8â€“14 (Week 2)
- Practiced Python functions (`functions_example.py`).
- Worked with lists, dictionaries, and loops (`lists_loops.py`).
- File handling project (`contact_book.py`).
- Exception handling and debugging practice.
- Built a simple To-Do CLI app (`todo.py`).
- Installed and tested Python library `requests` (`fetch_example.py`).
- Polished GitHub repo with **README.md** and documentation.

---

## ðŸ§  Skills Gained (So Far)
- File system organization & logging discipline.
- Python basics: variables, input, if/else, loops, functions.
- Small CLI projects (calculator, todo, contact book).
- Git & GitHub workflow (init â†’ add â†’ commit â†’ push).
- Office productivity practice (Word, Excel).
- First exposure to Python libraries (`requests`).

---

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Batch 2 (Days 15â€“28): Intermediate Python + mini-projects.
- Deeper Git/GitHub use (branches, merging, collaboration).
- Troubleshooting practice and automation projects.
- Continue structured logs + reflections.
