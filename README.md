# Python Essentials – Core Development Projects

This repository showcases my foundational and intermediate Python projects.  
It includes carefully structured exercises and practical scripts that demonstrate my growth in programming logic, automation, and clean coding practices.


### 1. Core Syntax & Problem Solving
Introductory programs that explore Python syntax, variables, data types, and control flow:
- `hello.py` – basic output and syntax
- `var_if_exercises.py` – conditional logic examples
- `lists_loops.py`, `Bravo_day15_lists_example.py` – iteration and list handling
- `Bravo_day17_dicts.py` – dictionary manipulations and lookups

### 2. Functions & Error Handling
Hands-on scripts emphasizing modular design and debugging:
- `functions_example.py`, `Bravo_day20_functions_practice.py`
- `errors_day11.txt`, `exceptions_example.py` – controlled error logging

### 3. File I/O and Data Management
Working with external data through reading, writing, and structured formats:
- `contact_book.py` and `contacts_bravo.csv` – simple CLI-based contact manager  
- `Bravo_day19_csv_example.py`, `people.csv` – CSV parsing and data storage  
- `todo.py`, `todo.txt` – file-driven task tracking application

### 4. Modules & Imports
Exploration of Python packages, imports, and reusable components:
- `utils_bravo.py` – shared utilities for data operations  
- `Bravo_day22_imports.py` – custom module demonstrations

### 5. API & Web Requests
Early examples of connecting Python to the web:
- `Bravo_day24_requests_adv.py` – fetching and processing online data  
- `fetch_example.py`, `fetch_example_offline.py` – request handling and offline testing

## Tech Stack

- Language: Python 3.x  
- Tools: Git, Visual Studio Code  
- Concepts: Procedural programming, file handling, debugging, modularization, and REST API consumption.

## Key Takeaways

- Strengthened understanding of Python fundamentals.  
- Built the habit of writing maintainable, well-commented code.  
- Practiced version control workflows using Git and GitHub.  
- Developed reusable scripts that simulate real-world use cases.
